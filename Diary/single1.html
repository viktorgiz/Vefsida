            <h3>Day 1 - january 14</h3>
            <p>
              This chapter includes the first day, i.e. the day we received the assignment. Most of the work the first assignment was done this day. Probably somehing around 60%.
              But it included finding a template, deciding the design of the page and creating it. I made almost all of the sites of the webpage this day. I did the site for the resume
              the manufacturing course, the University of Iceland site, and the front page.
            </p>
            <h4>The template</h4>
            <p> 
              Yesterday we recieved the homeassignment to create this website. That day I simply found a free template from the web and started changing it. First of when i thought about 
              what kind of template I needed I thought I wanted something simple, i.e. something I could understand easily, I didn't want the template to be to big. Also I knew that I needed.
              I needed a template which included some sites which could be used for a resume, introduction about my self, and which included a page where I could post my diary and my homeassigments.
              However I found a template from Theme Wagon, <a href="https://themewagon.com/themes/free-bootstrap-4-html5-business-website-template-cruise/?fbclid=IwAR1ob3YcxjLX7oNPrpiSSRYwp1tbyNz6gVDaKzEWPIwXS0dn_kAOhaekC6s">this is a link to it</a>
              I am not sure if they created it or colorlib, but anyway, they said it was free.
            </p>
            <h4>The Design</h4>
            <p>
              Of course a big part of the design of the website is the theme. However, the theme is a part of the template so I mostly do not have to worry about that. So far there have only
              been some minor issues I have had to change to implement the template into my design. I created two button for the about.html page which is the main page for the course. I also 
              changed the header. I changed the images and the name of the sites. I also changed the group-section in the manufacturing page. I had some issues making the photos of the group 
              memebers align. The photos weren't the same size so I had to use the "object-fit" mehod in css. However, I wasn't able to fix it quickly and I didn't believe I would within the
              hour, so I decided to use crop the photo, i.e. use a windows image program to make the photo smaller. Moreover, a lot of work changes were made by simply removing features included 
              in the template. A lot of the features weren't usefull; nevertheless, the template was great.
            </p>
            <h4>Tools</h4>
            <p>
              To easy my work I used git bash. I used only three commands, git add something.html, git commit -m "m, i think it means master, but this is a message", and git push. Evenmore
              I connected my site to github and hosted the site with github. Github is great. A link to github were all my code is in the icon in the footer. So it is possible 
              to access it from all the pages. However <a href = "https://github.com/viktorgiz/Framleidsluferli_vhg6">here is a link too</a>. I have had some trouble with allwoing people to access
              my github repository in the past, so if there is any trouble, then you can simply send me a mail and say "your repository isn't public, Fix it!". Here is my mail, vhg6@hi.is.
            </p>
            <h3> Day 2 - January 24</h3>
            <p> 
              This day included the first draft of the sites for the homeassignments and the diary. I used one of the sites included in the template, however i removed a lot of the features
              included in that site. So right now my plan is to put up two main sites for both the Home Assignment sites and the Diary sites. The name of the main pages will be blog.html and diary.html.
              Then on those two pages will be some cool design but up with dislpy flex which will have 4 columns and two rows and in each place will be a link (among other) to the diary or the assignment 
              selected. Anyway, today I simply put up the site for the home assignment. The site for the diary has still not been made. It will be comming soon.
            </p>
            <h3> Day 3 - February 4 </h3>
            <p>
              Well, today is the 4th of February and I still haven't finished the website. But today I put up the site for the diary. Also I added the href on the link on the Manufacturing page
              for the diary and the homeassignment main pages. Hoewever it isn't enough to  click the edge of the button, you need to click the text within it.
            </p>
